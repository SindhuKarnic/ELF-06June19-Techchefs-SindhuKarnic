----------------Trigger--------------

like stored proc which automatically invokes when a spl event occurs in db

CREATE
    /*[DEFINER = { user | CURRENT_USER }]*/
    TRIGGER `company`.`trigger1` BEFORE INSERT
    ON `company`.`employee`
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	insert into emp2 value(new.id,new.firstName,new.salary);
    END$$


Before: before inserting into first table, does the trigger operation
After: after inserting into first table, does the trigger operation

old: takes old values from the table and copies to new table
new: takes new values from the table and copies to new table
